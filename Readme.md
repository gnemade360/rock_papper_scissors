Certainly! Below is a README file template for your Python program implementing the Rock, Paper, Scissors game:

# Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python

## Introduction
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors Python program! This program allows you to play the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game against the computer. The game follows simple rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.

## Requirements
This program requires Python 3.x to run.

## How to Run the Game
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory containing the Python script (`rock_paper_scissors.py`).
3. Run the `rock_paper_scissors.py` script using the following command:
   ```
   python rock_paper_scissors.py
   ```
4. The game will start, and you can enter your choice by typing "rock", "paper", or "scissors" at the prompt.
5. The computer will then randomly select its choice, and the winner will be determined based on the game rules.
6. You can choose to play the game again or exit when prompted.

## Game Logic
1. The player is asked to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
2. The computer randomly selects its choice.
3. The winner is determined based on the following rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
   - If both the player and computer make the same choice, it's a tie.

## Customization
- You can modify the `get_user_choice` function to allow for different input formats or variations of the game.
- If you want to change the computer's selection logic, you can modify the `get_computer_choice` function to implement a different strategy.
